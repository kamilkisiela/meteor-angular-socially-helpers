# Saving git log to file

Helps you to keep track of changes and tags.

```bash
git log --oneline --decorate > log.txt
```

It's nice to have a log from the original source and a log of the current state.

Mostly to compare them using tools like `meld` on Linux or something similar.

It makes life easier!
